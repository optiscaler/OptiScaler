// Turns the upscaler's linear HDR output into the kind of picture Neural Rendering was trained on, and
// folds the model's answer back into the frame.
//
// Two passes:
//
//   ENCODE   linear HDR -> an sRGB-encoded picture in [0,1], plus an untouched copy of the frame. The
//            picture is what the model is shown; the copy is what the answer is folded back into.
//
//   RESOLVE  proxy + model output + that copy -> the finished frame.
//
// The first version of this decoded the model's output back through the inverse of the tone curve, and
// that is what turned every strip light in Cyberpunk into a string of coloured cells. Two reasons, both
// fatal on highlights:
//
//   * The curve was applied per channel, so a saturated bright light had its channels compressed by
//     different amounts and came back a different hue.
//
//   * x/(1-x) diverges as x approaches one. A light sitting at 0.99 in the encoded picture reconstructs
//     to a hundred times the white point, and the model nudging one channel by a thousandth moves that
//     by tens of percent. Highlights are exactly where the model has least to say and where the inverse
//     amplifies most, which is the worst possible combination.
//
// The resolve does not reconstruct the frame by inverting that encode. It keeps the original and
// rescales the model's own picture onto it, so nothing depends on the encode being invertible and a
// bright pixel is never reconstructed from a compressed one. At zero strength the frame is
// bit-for-bit what the upscaler produced.
