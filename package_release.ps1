# The build output directory is not the release: it also holds import libraries, export files, debug
# symbols, and whatever earlier experiments left behind. Shipping that folder wholesale is how a
# release ends up containing a DLL nobody meant to publish, so this copies an explicit list and
# refuses anything not on it.
#
# What is deliberately NOT here: nvngx_dlssnr.dll. That is NVIDIA's, it is not ours to redistribute,
# and the user supplies their own copy per game folder. Only the ~108 KB forwarder ships.
